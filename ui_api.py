"""Route composition for the Hermes ChatGPT UI (v0.8 Fabric).

This is a COMPOSITION-ONLY file (architecture.md §16): it owns the route
registry, the JSON envelope shape, and static serving of the built SPA. It
does not implement feature routes. Each feature card contributes a
``<module>_routes()`` function:

- ``ui_security_routes()`` — boundary, /api/me, /api/connection
- ``ui_chat_routes()``     — sessions + chat SSE
- ``ui_ops_routes()``      — operator adapters + gated mutations
- ``ui_fabric_routes()``   — Fabric distributed read models, GET-only
- ``ui_missions_routes()`` — v0.9 Mission/delegation live read models, GET-only

The registry composes whatever sibling modules are present. In parallel
worktrees a sibling module may be absent mid-build; a missing or broken
sibling degrades the registry instead of crashing the server (its own tests
exercise the module directly).

The JSON envelope (``ok`` / ``err``) is implemented in ``ui_security`` next
to the redaction boundary and re-exported here so every handler that builds a
browser payload goes through redaction by construction. ``ui_chat`` passes
``content_allowed=True`` only for the user's own conversation text.

    subpath return a 404 placeholder instead of being omitted entirely.

    The Mount("/ui") makes StaticFiles serve the directory. Because a Starlette
    Mount only matches when the path has a trailing slash, we also add an exact
    Route("/ui") so the bare /ui path returns the SPA shell. A custom
    _SPAStaticFiles subclass falls back to index.html for any missing path so
    the React Router client routes resolve. Assets are referenced by the Vite
    build with base=/ui/ and therefore load under /ui/assets/..., which this
