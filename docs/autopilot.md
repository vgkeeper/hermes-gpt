# Autopilot (v0.13)

Autopilot runs one Mission through its MissionPlan without a human re-triggering every node: it places nodes on capable peers, runs independent nodes in parallel, observes and validates their results, retries or replans within hard bounds, and stops at every approval boundary. It is **default off** and it adds no authority. Hermes GPT remains the only authority boundary; Autopilot is a caller of the existing Mission, plan, placement, Work Contract, delegation, budget, and live-event surfaces.

This is the current operational guide. `docs/design/v0.13-autopilot.md` records design intent and the findings behind it; where they disagree, the code and tests win.

## Enabling it

Autopilot needs both of these, in addition to the normal Operator policy:

- the machine gate `HERMES_GPT_AUTOPILOT=1` (read live; unset means off). While it is unset the three tools below are **not registered**, so the connector surface is unchanged; with it set there are three more. The 137-tool count is the upstream v0.13 baseline; this fork adds four Pilote adapter tools independently.
- per call: Operator `workspace` level, direct apply mode, `dry_run=false`, and `confirm=true`. A dry run previews the start and writes nothing.

## Tools

| Tool | Access | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hermes_autopilot_start` | dry-run first; direct needs `confirm=true` and the machine gate | Validates the Mission, then starts one detached worker process for it. Idempotent while a run is live. |
| `hermes_autopilot_status` | read-only | The run, its worker, and a derived `summary` (below). Reconciles worker liveness first. |
| `hermes_autopilot_stop` | dry-run first; direct needs `confirm=true`; the machine gate is not required | Stops the worker. Stopping is never gated behind starting. |

`hermes_autopilot_start` refuses, before writing anything, unless the Mission exists and is not terminal, a MissionPlan exists with at least one node, and every node's required skills resolve through the canonical skill resolver.

### Start parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `max_concurrency` | 3 | 1-16 | Nodes running at once. |
| `max_replans` | 2 | 0-10 | Rework replans allowed for the run. |
| `max_attempts_per_node` | 3 | 1-10 | Attempts per node, first attempt included. |
| `max_runtime_seconds` | 86400 | 60-604800 | After this the run starts no new work, drains what is in flight, and ends. |

## What the worker does

The worker survives an MCP server restart or disconnect: it is a separate process, and every status read re-verifies it rather than trusting a cached record. Each pass (a "tick") it holds the controller's per-mission lease and:

1. **Observes** every in-flight node through `hermes_delegation_reconcile`, which reads runner and Fabric records and never the worker's own claim of success. A node completes only if its Work Contract validates `SATISFIED` against observed state and the evidence is bound to the contract hash. Anything missing or partial completes nothing.
2. **Schedules** ready nodes, in node-id order, up to `max_concurrency`, through the existing chain: placement scoring, contract validation, then the delegation dispatch. There is no separate dispatch path. Dispatch is idempotent: an exact retry resolves to the same delegation, and a crash between dispatch and the node update is adopted on the next pass rather than dispatched again.
3. **Reports** its state and a derived summary.

Ticks are event-driven where possible (it long-polls the Mission's live events) with a periodic backstop, `HERMES_GPT_AUTOPILOT_IDLE_SECONDS` (default 2.0, clamped to 0.5-60). Events only shorten the wait: no event is ever treated as proof, and every wakeup re-reads durable state.

## What it will never do

- **Cross an approval boundary.** Approval nodes and `high_impact` nodes are never dispatched or advanced. Autopilot reports `waiting_for_owner` and dispatches nothing past that node; independent branches keep running. You resolve it with the existing tools, and Autopilot resumes.
- **Approve or complete the Mission.** Once every node is done it calls the existing Mission reconcile, which stops at `awaiting_approval` while final approval is required. Only `hermes_mission_approve`, in Owner mode, completes the Mission. The worker holds no Owner authority.
- **Dispatch past a budget.** Before each new dispatch (retries included) it requires the budget envelope to be verifiably within its limit, and holds otherwise, whether or not the budget hard-block gates are armed. An unreadable or invalid envelope also holds. An account-less Mission is unrestricted. Observation of running work continues while held.
- **Write against a replaced plan.** Its plan writes are compare-and-swap on the plan version; a replaced plan aborts the pass.
- **Run two schedulers for one Mission.** One run per Mission, and the controller's per-mission lease is held for each pass.

## Recovery

Every failure is classified by the existing failure classifier; Autopilot adds no opinion of its own.

- A **transient** failure (for example a rate limit or a reset connection) is retried, with backoff (base 30s, cap 15 minutes), on another capable peer when one exists, up to `max_attempts_per_node`.
- A **semantic** failure with an eligible replan proposal is replanned, up to `max_replans`: the failed node is kept as history and a rework clone with the same definition takes its place. A replan never touches a completed node, lowers an authorization class, or removes an approval node.
- Everything else (authority, capability, environment, ambiguous, or an unclassifiable failure such as a bare "worker crashed") fails the node and is reported as needing a human. It is never retried.

A failed attempt normally fails the whole Mission when reconciled, so a replaced attempt is marked superseded once its successor exists. See [missions.md](missions.md) for how that marker is protected against misuse.

## States and status

Run states: `starting`, `running`, `waiting_for_owner`, `stopping`, `stopped`, `completed`, `failed`. `waiting_for_owner` means the approval frontier (or the Mission's own approval gate) is reached and nothing else can proceed.

`hermes_autopilot_status` returns the run and worker as before, plus a derived, read-only `summary`: progress, in-flight workers, the approval frontier, the budget view, recovery counters, limits and runtime remaining, wake-up counters, and an `attention` list with `needs_owner`. Building the summary never enforces a budget or writes anything, and if it cannot be built it degrades to `{"available": false}`.

Attention items marked `owner` are the ones only a human can resolve: the Mission awaiting approval, a gated node, a budget that is crossed, invalid or unreadable, and an unrecovered failed node. An expired runtime or a silent worker is informational.

## Flight Deck

`GET /api/ops/missions/{mission_id}/autopilot` shows the run read-only in the browser. It writes nothing, reports a dead worker as stale rather than as running, and returns only an allow-listed set of fields. See [flight-deck-missions.md](flight-deck-missions.md).

## Data and persistence

Run state lives under the Hermes data root in `autopilot/<mission_id>.json` (mode 0600, written atomically under a lock) and holds orchestration metadata only: limits, counters, worker liveness, and recovery bookkeeping. Mission, plan, delegation, and evidence stores stay the source of truth, and raw prompts, transcripts, and credentials are never stored.

## Verification

- `python -m pytest test_operator_autopilot.py test_operator_autopilot_scheduler.py test_operator_autopilot_advance.py test_operator_autopilot_frontier.py test_operator_autopilot_recovery.py test_operator_autopilot_limits.py test_operator_autopilot_wakeup.py test_operator_autopilot_status.py`
- `python -m pytest test_operator_mission_supersede.py test_operator_plan_rework.py test_ui_autopilot.py`
- `python -m pytest test_operator_autopilot_acceptance.py` runs the end-to-end scenario with a real detached worker, a killed peer, an approval stop and resume, and an MCP server restarted mid-Mission.
