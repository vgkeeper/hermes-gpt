# Flight Deck Missions (v0.13)

Status: current, opt-in browser UI. Hermes GPT mounts its `/ui` and browser API routes only when `HERMES_GPT_UI_ENABLED=1`; with the variable unset, the UI route registry and API modules are not imported and the existing MCP surface is unchanged. This gate controls only the Hermes GPT browser UI and does not configure, replace, or start a separate Hermes WebUI deployment. When mounted, UI requests remain inside the existing Bearer/OAuth middleware and browser redaction boundary; see [UI security and state boundary](ui-security-boundary.md). Mission lifecycle and authorization remain documented in [Missions](missions.md) and [Operator Mode](operator-mode.md).

Flight Deck exposes first-class Missions as a read-only operational view. The browser does not gain Mission mutation, dispatch, cancellation, reconciliation, or approval authority.

## Routes

- `GET /api/ops/missions` — bounded Mission list with current durable state.
- `GET /api/ops/missions/{mission_id}` — durable Mission detail plus linked delegation summaries.
- `GET /api/ops/missions/{mission_id}/events` — bounded cursor/long-poll wake-up events filtered to one Mission.
- `GET /api/ops/missions/{mission_id}/autopilot` — the Mission's Autopilot run (v0.13), read-only; see below.
- `GET /api/ops/delegations/{delegation_id}` — one normalized delegation read model.

All browser payloads pass through the existing Flight Deck redaction boundary. Mission and Delegation stores remain authoritative; live-event payloads are wake-up notices only. The detail screen responds to a wake-up by re-reading durable Mission state rather than treating the event payload as completion evidence.

## Visible Mission state

The Mission list/detail screens expose bounded title/objective metadata, owner profile, status/version, acceptance criteria, context references and digests, explicit skills manifests, approval presence/requirement, attachments, linked delegation state, and recent Mission events.

The detail endpoint captures its live-event cursor before reading the Mission snapshot. This prevents a state transition racing with the snapshot from being skipped: the change is either already reflected in the durable snapshot or remains after the returned cursor and wakes the browser for another durable read.

## Authority boundary

The Mission UI contains no direct mutation controls. State transitions, attachment writes, reconciliation, delegation dispatch/cancel, and Owner approval continue through their existing operator surfaces and policy gates. Flight Deck is presentation and observation only.

## Autopilot view (v0.13)

`GET /api/ops/missions/{mission_id}/autopilot` shows the durable Autopilot run for a Mission: its state, limits, replan count, last scheduling pass (dispatched/held/failed nodes, the approval frontier, any budget or runtime limit that stopped new work), wake-up counters, and the recovery bookkeeping counts. It exists whether or not `HERMES_GPT_AUTOPILOT` is set, because it only reads a run that already exists; with no run it returns `found: false`. Starting, stopping, and every decision Autopilot makes remain outside the browser.

It follows the same rules as the rest of this screen:

- **GET only, no writes.** Unlike the `hermes_autopilot_status` MCP tool, which heals the stored run record and reconciles the job, this route writes nothing. It stays truthful anyway: it checks worker liveness without writing and reports an `effective_state` with `stale: true` when the stored record says `running` but the worker is dead or already finished. The stored record is shown as found.
- **Allow-listed fields.** The browser receives an explicit projection of the run, not the stored record, so a field added later is never exposed by accident. No process ids, config hashes, placements, or raw recovery internals.
- **Derived summary.** The response includes a `summary` (progress, approval frontier, budget, recovery counters, limits, wake-up counters, and an `attention` list with `needs_owner`) built by the same code as the `hermes_autopilot_status` tool. It is an allow-listed projection: worker peers, delegation ids, and unlisted fields are never sent, and if it cannot be built the route returns `{"available": false}` while still reporting the run. Reading it never enforces a budget or pauses a Mission.
- **Cursor first.** `live_cursor` is captured before the durable read, as on the Mission detail route.
- **Redacted and read-level.** The payload passes through the Flight Deck redaction boundary and requires the Operator read level.

The view is a snapshot to re-read on a wake-up, never proof: Mission, plan, delegation, and evidence stores remain authoritative.
