# Hermes ChatGPT UI — Security & State Boundary Notes

Status: current (implementation card t_7266e74c, 2026-08-15)
Scope: `ui_security.py`, `ui_api.py` (composition), `server.py` mount,
`web/src/shared/**`, `web/src/stores/connection.ts`, `test_ui_security.py`.

These notes document the browser-facing security boundary for the
conversational Hermes GPT UI. The authoritative design is
`architecture.md` / `interface-contracts.md` (kanban t_ab4f3463); this file
records what the boundary actually enforces and how to verify it.

---

## 1. What crosses the boundary

Every browser-bound payload (JSON response body and SSE `data` line) is
serialized through `ui_security.redact_browser`. The two JSON envelope
helpers (`ui_api.ok` / `ui_api.err`, implemented in `ui_security`) apply
redaction automatically, so a handler cannot skip it by accident.

- `ok(data)` — strict redaction (default).
- `ok(data, content_allowed=True)` — used ONLY for the user's own
  conversation text (chat thread `content`, SSE `token`/`reasoning`
  `delta`). Everything else in that payload still gets the strict treatment.
- `err(code, message)` — message is redacted before it leaves the server.

SSE event payloads are redacted per-event by the chat bridge using the same
function; tool events (`tool_start`/`tool_end`) use the strict default.

## 2. What is redacted (strict mode)

- Raw prompts, memory bodies, transcripts, request dumps, credentials, and
  profile-secret bodies: values under secret-key names (`prompt`, `token`,
  `secret`, `password`, `credentials`, `memory_body`, `transcript`,
  `request_dump`, `client_secret`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`,
  `authorization`, `cookie`, `private_key`, `profile_secret`, …) become
  `[REDACTED]`. Never silently empty.
- `content` / `delta` keys in strict mode are treated as raw message bodies
  and redacted entirely (they survive only via `content_allowed=True`).
- Secret substrings: `sk-…` / `sk-proj-…` OpenAI keys, `AKIA…` AWS keys,
  `Bearer <token>`, `token=|secret=|password=|api_key=` values (reuses
  `operator_policy.redact_output`).
- PII in operator-derived text: emails, phone numbers, `@handles`, name
  labels (mirrors `operator_mission._sanitize_error`).
- Absolute filesystem paths (POSIX home paths, Windows drive paths, UNC, `~/...`) →
  `[REDACTED_PATH]`; secret-file paths (`secrets/…`, `.env`, `auth.json`,
  `hermes_gpt_tokens.json`, `hermes_gpt_tokens.db`, `hermes_gpt_token_key`, `.ssh/…`) →
  `[REDACTED_SECRETS_PATH]`. Store paths are never exposed.
- Length cap: every string in strict mode is truncated to
  `HERMES_GPT_UI_TOOL_PREVIEW_BYTES` (default 8192) with a `…[truncated]`
  marker. Chat content is bounded at 1 MiB (conversation text is not a tool
  preview).

`content_allowed=True` skips PII/path mangling and the 8 KiB cap for the
user's own text only; unambiguous secret shapes are still removed.

## 3. Authn / authz

- The UI reuses `oauth_auth.BearerAuthMiddleware` and the existing
  `build_asgi_app` wiring — **loopback default (no auth)**; static bearer or
  confidential-client OAuth when configured; remote profile remains blocked
  by the existing server gates. The UI adds no auth path of its own.
- UI routes mount BEFORE `Mount("/", mcp_app)` when
  `HERMES_GPT_UI_ENABLED=1`, so same-origin `/api/*` and `/ui` calls never
  fall through to the MCP catch-all. With the env unset, the mount code is
  not even imported — installed wheels without the UI modules are unaffected.

## 4. Account status (`GET /api/me`)

`accountStatus` is derived read-only from the durable token store
(`token_store.status`), never from token material:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ok` | no auth configured (loopback), or static bearer, or valid store |
| `expired` | durable store present, `expires_at` in the past |
| `revoked` | durable store unreadable/corrupt (tokens unusable) |
| `unauthorized` | OAuth configured but no usable durable store — re-auth needed |

`/api/me` also returns `operatorLevel` (policy snapshot), `allowedSurfaces`
(v0.7 Mission allowlist semantics: unset = all, list = only listed, empty =
none — the unset state is NOT "deny by default"), and `uiCapabilities`
(permission-aware: the mutating `approvals` lane drops when the account is
degraded or the level is below `workspace`; read-only lanes stay).

## 5. Connection / stale-state helpers

- `GET /api/connection` returns a per-process `serverStartupId`; the
  connection store compares it across polls to detect a server restart
  mid-session and surfaces the in-flight turn as interrupted (recoverable via
  persisted messages + turn lease), never as running.
- `is_stale_lease(ts)` treats a turn lease older than
  `HERMES_GPT_UI_STALE_LEASE_S` (default 600) as stale → interrupted UX.
- `web/src/shared/ConnectionStatus.tsx` renders transport health;
  `web/src/shared/AccountStatusBanner.tsx` renders the expired/revoked/
  unauthorized recovery UX (re-auth affordance, mutating controls disabled,
  read-only chat history stays viewable). Wiring the account store into the
  banner is the flight card's job (t_1135e15b owns `web/src/stores/account.ts`).

## 6. Mutations remain auditable and gated

This card adds NO mutation surface. Every mutation the UI offers goes
through the existing gated `hermes_*` tool path (`POST /api/ops/action`,
flight card t_1135e15b): read-only default, dry-run-first, confirm gate
preserved (409 `CONFIRM_REQUIRED`), Owner Mode never bypasses secret-path
protections, and every call is written to the operator audit JSONL. The
boundary only guarantees the response is redacted and the envelope
(`ok`/`error`, gate codes) is never weakened — `test_error_envelope_
preserves_gate_codes` asserts that.

## 7. Env vars (architecture.md §15)

| Env | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `HERMES_GPT_UI_ENABLED` | unset (off) | mount UI routes + static serving |
| `HERMES_GPT_UI_PROFILE` | `default` | profile the UI runs as |
| `HERMES_GPT_UI_DIR` | `web/dist` | static build output override |
| `HERMES_GPT_UI_STALE_LEASE_S` | `600` | stale turn-lease threshold |
| `HERMES_GPT_UI_TOOL_PREVIEW_BYTES` | `8192` | per-string / tool-preview cap |

Existing env behavior is unchanged.

## 8. Verification

```bash
python -m pytest test_ui_security.py      # 36 tests: redaction properties,
                                          # account states, auth boundary,
                                          # allowlist semantics, /api/* sweep
cd web && npm install && npx tsc --noEmit  # frontend shared skeleton typecheck
```

Property sweep: `test_property_all_api_get_routes_redacted` walks every
mounted `GET /api/*` route and asserts the body is free of forbidden
patterns; `test_property_sse_payloads_redacted` runs every SSE event shape
through the boundary. When chat/flight routes land in later cards, the same
sweep covers them automatically.

## 9. Known environment note (not from this card)

`test_mcp_compat.py::test_package_metadata_allows_mcp_1x_floor` fails in
this venv because the installed `hermes-gpt` distribution metadata is stale
(0.5.0, from before the `mcp[cli]>=1.0,<2` floor). It reads installed
metadata, not the working tree; it is unaffected by this card's diff.
