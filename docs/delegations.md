# Unified Delegation Lifecycle (v0.9)

Hermes GPT v0.9 adds a durable delegation lifecycle above Work Contracts and the existing execution backends. The delegation record is **lineage and state metadata**, not a second execution authority: runner, Fabric, Work Contract validation, and Operator policy remain authoritative for dispatch, observation, cancellation, and completion evidence.

## Tools

- `hermes_delegation_dispatch` — dry-run-first dispatch of a canonical Work Contract with optional Mission linkage.
- `hermes_delegation_get` — read one durable delegation and its bounded lifecycle events.
- `hermes_delegation_list` — list/filter delegation records by Mission or normalized state.
- `hermes_delegation_reconcile` — derive normalized state from authoritative runner/Fabric observations; applying the derived state requires workspace/direct authority.
- `hermes_delegation_cancel` — route cancellation to the selected backend while preserving existing backend cancellation and Operator gates.

Normalized states are `queued`, `running`, `reconciling`, `blocked`, `succeeded`, `failed`, and `cancelled`.

## Data and authority boundaries

The delegation database stores only bounded lineage and lifecycle metadata: delegation id, Mission id, Work Contract task id and SHA-256, selected backend, normalized/backend state, bounded backend references, timestamps, and event hashes. It does **not** store Work Contract objectives/prompts or model responses.

A delegation never marks work successful because a worker says it succeeded. Reconciliation reads the existing runner/Fabric observations for the Work Contract task id, but backend terminal success remains `reconciling` until the matching immutable Work Contract lineage has a `SATISFIED` validation verdict. Missing, unreadable, or `UNVERIFIED` evidence therefore fails closed. When a Work Contract is supplied to reconciliation, its canonical SHA and task id must match the stored lineage before validation can contribute evidence.

Mission linkage uses the existing `delegation` attachment kind. Dispatch creates/updates a pending/running attachment. A Mission attachment becomes `succeeded` only when delegation reconciliation has both authoritative backend completion and a `SATISFIED` Work Contract verdict; that bridge records the contract digest as its verification reference. Cancellation records `cancelled` only when the backend explicitly confirms `cancelled`/`canceled`. Other successful backend responses remain reconciling. An explicit unsuccessful, unchanged backend response releases the provisional cancellation latch; ambiguous failures remain latched for authoritative reconciliation.

An exact cancellation retry does not invoke backend cancellation again while `cancellation_in_progress` is set for that lineage. It returns an explicit in-progress/ambiguous idempotent response and leaves the latch in place for the first caller or authoritative reconciliation.

Authoritative reconciliation resolves that provisional latch only from a terminal backend observation demonstrably ordered after the durable cancellation claim. The observation must carry a parseable, timezone-aware backend terminal timestamp such as `ended_at` or `completed_at`, and that timestamp must be strictly later than `cancellation_claimed_at`. Payload/hash differences, visibility time, generic update time, and equal timestamps do not establish ordering. A backend without a trustworthy post-attempt terminal timestamp or advancing authoritative generation therefore remains latched fail-closed. A post-claim explicit `cancelled`/`canceled` observation promotes durable cancellation; post-claim terminal failure clears the latch and records failure; post-claim terminal completion clears the latch but still requires the normal matching Work Contract validation before success. Missing, stale, ambiguous, unknown, or nonterminal observation retains `cancel_requested` and `cancellation_in_progress` and remains `reconciling`.

## OpenCode backend

v0.9 also adds `opencode` as a first-class local runner backend. Hermes invokes the installed non-interactive OpenCode CLI using `opencode run --format json --pure --dir <workspace>`. The objective is piped over stdin rather than placed on process argv. `--auto` is never enabled by Hermes.

Filesystem authority is enforced externally by the same Hermes confinement layer used for local coding runners. Read-only contracts receive read-only workspace confinement; write-authorized contracts require `workspace-write` posture. Optional `model`, `agent`, and `variant` execution options are bounded, and model selection remains subject to the existing runner model allowlist.

Provider authorization stays in the trusted Hermes worker. The confined OpenCode process receives a fresh per-job random relay capability and a sanitized provider configuration; the loopback relay rejects missing or incorrect capabilities before forwarding and substitutes the upstream authorization only after that check. The upstream authorization is never serialized into the child config, argv, workspace, or child environment.

## OpenHands Cloud runner

Coding Work Contracts may explicitly select `execution.backend=openhands`; this is not a fallback target. The contract's execution options must include an explicit `repository` slug and `branch`. `execution.options.timeout_seconds` sets the per-contract wall-clock limit: it defaults to 86400 seconds and accepts integers from 60 through 604800. Normal Operator direct-mode, workspace-level, dry-run, confirmation, Work Contract, and delegation gates still apply. Credentials are injected at runtime through `OPENHANDS_CLOUD_API_KEY` (or `OPENHANDS_API_KEY`) and are never written to runner metadata; the optional `HERMES_GPT_OPENHANDS_BASE_URL` must be HTTPS. No live job is required to configure or test the backend.

OpenHands start-task and conversation status are observed across server restarts. The runner persists the timeout and absolute deadline before submission, enforces it during subsequent observations, and fails closed to `needs_attention` when the deadline is reached or active metadata has no valid deadline. `awaiting_user_input` and equivalent user-wait states also become `needs_attention`; they do not remain active indefinitely. Missing auth, API errors, and unknown result/status shapes produce bounded failure or `needs_attention`; none becomes successful Work Contract evidence. These attention outcomes are not automatically retried by Autopilot. They do not cancel remote OpenHands work: cancellation is reported unsupported rather than guessed. There is no automatic fallback to Codex, OpenCode, Pi, OMX, or Fleet. Work Contract validation remains authoritative.


## Live events

Delegation lifecycle changes publish bounded wake-up events on the v0.9 live-event bus. These notifications are non-authoritative pointers back to durable delegation/runner/Fabric state; notification failure cannot advance or complete work.
