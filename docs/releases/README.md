# Release-planning artifacts

Files in this directory preserve the release brief, integrated plan, risk reviews, counsel packet, and related pre-release evidence.

## Historical v0.7 Flight Deck artifacts

- `v0.7-flight-deck-research-package.md` — grounded research package + release brief (G1).
- `v0.7-flight-deck-risk-register.md` — architecture risk register (G2; input to legal review).
- `v0.7-flight-deck-implementation-plan.md` — implementation plan with independently verifiable slices (G3).
- `v0.7-flight-deck-legal-risk-review.md` — legal/compliance/privacy/security risk review memo with go/no-go gate recommendations (G2; input to implementation and G4/G5).
- `v0.7-flight-deck-implementation-evidence.md` — implementation evidence + JUnit test report for slices S0-S9 (G3; t_d31703e4).
- `v0.7-flight-deck-verification-report.md` — independent verification report, G4 code-level pass with gate conditions (t_8e69d56b).
- `v0.7-flight-deck-defect-list.md` — recorded defects D1-D8 from the independent pass (t_8e69d56b; not yet fixed).
- `v0.7-flight-deck-demo-script.md` — runnable local demo of the v0.7 surfaces (t_8e69d56b).
- `v0.7-flight-deck-trt-handoff.md` — TRT technical editorial source pack with verified claims and guardrails (t_8e69d56b).
- `v0.7-flight-deck-tony-handoff.md` — Tony approval-gate summary (t_8e69d56b).

These are **historical release-program artifacts** for the v0.7.0 Flight Deck
release. They preserve the program's research, risk, implementation, and approval
records. Status statements such as "DRAFT", "pending approval", or "candidate"
record the state at the time the artifact was written; they are not current
release status or runtime instructions. The release records themselves are
preserved unchanged.

## Historical v0.6 artifacts

The following preserve the v0.6.0 brief, integrated plan, risk reviews, counsel packet, and related pre-release evidence.

They are retained for provenance. They are **not current release-status or runtime instructions**.

Some files intentionally contain language such as:

- candidate;
- gate pending;
- before release;
- approval required;
- do not publish yet.

That language records the state at the time the artifact was written. The final v0.6.0 GitHub release occurred later.

Agents should read [../README.md](../README.md) before using these files.

Use these artifacts for:

- reconstructing release rationale and approval history;
- understanding identified risks and mitigations;
- reviewing the intended surface inventory;
- tracing how v0.6 requirements were decomposed.

Do not use them alone to determine:

- whether v0.6.0 is currently released;
- whether PyPI has a particular version;
- current tool names or schemas;
- current environment defaults;
- current retention enforcement;
- whether a historical release gate remains open.

Verify current claims against implementation/tests, current operational docs, and the active distribution channel.
